In late 2012 we brewed King Julius on our original Brew Magic brewing system - a whole ten gallons of it! Despite the size of the batch the memory of it is enormous in our hearts.

As we continue to move forward in our journey it felt like the perfect time to pay homage to our beginnings. King Julius is our endeavor to marry our past with what we aspire to be in the future. King Julius is an American Double IPA brewed to be an exceptionally flavorful juicy and hop saturated beer while never tiring the palate.
