Lagunitas Sucks,Lagunitas Brewing Company,California,United States,lagunitas.com,American Double  Imperial IPA, 7.85%, Year-round,This sad holiday season we didn’t have the brewing capacity to make our favorite seasonal brew the widely feared BrownShugga’ Ale. You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin’ along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever.

He was referring to the complex super-critical-CO2 hop extraction equipment set up on the table in the lab across from the brewhouse. Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse. The sensuous honey-like amber ooze was administered intravenously to the wort kettle and the sacrament was complete. Another kettle of Hop Stoopid is once again raised up and fermented on high.",#1229,2180,7814,336

Sahati,The Ale Apothecary,Oregon,United States,thealeapothecary.com,Sahti, 10.50%, Rotating,SAHATI is our interpretation of traditional Finnish sahti. Starting with a 200-year old Engelmann spruce tree felled on brewery property we created our own kuurna (an ancient Scandinavian lauter tun) to separate the wort from the grain during brewing. The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year.  SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves.,#1343,15,144,129

Brooklyn Lager,Brooklyn Brewery,New York,United States,brooklynbrewery.com,American Amber  Red Lager, 5.20%, Year-round,In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country home to more than 45 breweries. Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping” the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer smooth refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.,#29237,1258,3737,127

This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process some of the water content turns to ice effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.,#9495,25,46,118

Smoked Porter - Chipotle Peppers,Stone Brewing,California,United States,stonebrewing.com,Smoked Beer, 5.90%, Rotating,In 2006 Chris Carroll a longtime member of Team Stone took that adage literally proposing that we produce a one-off version of our venerable Stone Smoked Porter made spicy from the addition of chipotle peppers. We gave it a shot and found that those smoked jalapeños melded quite naturally with the smoldery peat-smoked malt that gives the beer its flavor and moniker creating a deep roasty quaff with a carefully restrained tingle of tasteful capsaicin heat in the finish. The marriage of ingredients was so nice that it has become an annual summertime staple released each May in honor of Carroll’s initial idea that Stone Smoked Porter wChipotle Peppers serve as an artisanal alternative to the industrialized adjunct-laden cerveza billed as the perfect fluid accompaniment to the sunny season.
