The Beer class stores the stats, info, and ratings of a particular beer. The User class stores similar data but for a specific user. With this data, we hope we are able to make novel product recommendations for online users."

    "The $\\text{scrape_burger}$( ) function is fundamental to this web scraping method. With this function we can pass in a url and search the html text for certain words. For example, say one line in the html file is \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{\"<dl><dt>Birthday:</dt> <dd>Jan 29, 1977 (Age: 41)</dd></dl>\"}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we are interested in extracting the user's birthday. In order to extract this info we can call the burger function with following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "scrape_burger(url='someurl' , top_bun='Birthday', bottom_bun = '$\\text{</dd>}$', napkins='$\\text{<dd>}$')\n",
    "\n",
    "The top_bun and bottom_bun parameters specify that any text in between these buns should be scraped. This leads to the following string\n",
    "\n",
    "\"$\\text{:</dt> <dd>Jan 29, 1977 (Age: 41)}$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The napkins parameters is then used to \"clean up\" the string above so that only text after the napkins' flag is kept. This leads to the final string which is what we hoped to extract:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"$\\text{Jan 29, 1977 (Age: 41)}$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this function in many different ways in this method in order to scrape data of interest from the website. The downsides of this methods are that it can be quite tedious to find the parameters from the html text that scrape the data of interest. Also, this method is somewhat inefficient as we perform $\\texttt{wget}$ and $\\texttt{grep}$ on the same webpage multiple times in order to extract different pieces of data. It would be quicker to parse the entire html text only one time. Another possible issue is that this method relies on the uniform structure of beer and user pages on BeerAdvocate. If beer and user pages slightly differ, the data could be incorrectly scraped. However, this issue has not come up in our testing so far."
